Hello, I am a second-year master student studying computer science at University of California, San Diego. 

I am broadly intersted in machine learning and robotics, and most recently I've been working on machine learning for collision detection, at the [ARCLab](https://sites.google.com/site/ucsdarclab/) under [Michael Yip](https://sites.google.com/site/mikeyip1/).
