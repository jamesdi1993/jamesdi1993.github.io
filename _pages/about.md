Hello, I am a first-year master student studying computer science at University of California, San Diego. 

I am broadly intersted in machine learning and robotics, and most recently I've been working on self-collision analysis on high degree of freedom robots and latent-space motion planning, at the [ARCLab](https://sites.google.com/site/ucsdarclab/) under [Michael Yip](https://sites.google.com/site/mikeyip1/)
