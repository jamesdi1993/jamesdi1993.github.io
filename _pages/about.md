Hello, I am currently a machine learning engineer at TikTok & Bytedance. I work on improving user ads experience by incorporating fairer statistical signals and auction formula into our ads ranking algorithms. 

I am broadly intersted in machine learning and robotics. I recently completed a M.S program in computer science, with a focus on robotics at University of California, San Diego. I researched on machine learning for collision detection, with application in pose optimization for multi-arm manipulators at [ARCLab](https://sites.google.com/site/ucsdarclab/) under [Michael Yip](https://sites.google.com/site/mikeyip1/). I also conducted a summer internship on object detection for loop-closuring at [ERCLab](http://erl.ucsd.edu/) under [Nicholay Atanasov](https://natanaso.github.io/). 

My aspiration is to devote to robotics research and applications that contribute to the social goods. Please see my [sample](research_proposal_James_short.pdf) research proposal to get a sense of the work that excites me. 

You can find my most recent CV [here](James_resume_public_02_15_21.pdf).
