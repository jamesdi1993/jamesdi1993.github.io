Hello, I am currently a machine learning engineer at TikTok & Bytedance. I work on improving user ads experience by incorporating fairer statistical signals and auction formula into our ads ranking algorithms. 

I am broadly intersted in machine learning and robotics. I recently completed a M.S program in Computer Science, with a focus on Robotics at University of California, San Diego. I worked on machine learning for collision detection, with applications in surgical robotics at the [ARCLab](https://sites.google.com/site/ucsdarclab/) under [Michael Yip](https://sites.google.com/site/mikeyip1/). I also conducted a summer internship on object detection for loop-closuring at the [ERCLab](http://erl.ucsd.edu/) under [Nicholay Atanasov](https://natanaso.github.io/). 

You can find my most recent CV [here](James_resume_public_02_15_21.pdf).
